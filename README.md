## Markov Project Code!

If you want to see the code for the project, it is under the src directory. All files under the app directory are rendered to the screen.
Components are modules rendered to the screen on pages, and lib files are helper files (all the markov-chaining and csv parsing)

Check out https://markov-chain-stock-prediction.vercel.app/ to view the app!
